Cruelty has a Human heart  
And Jealousy a Human Face,  
Terror, the Human Form Divine,  
And Secrecy, [the Human Dress](index.md).  

The Human Dress is forg√©d Iron,  
The Human Form, a fiery Forge,  
The Human Face, a Furnace seal'd,  
The Human Heart, its hungry Gorge.

(*A Divine Image*, William Blake)
